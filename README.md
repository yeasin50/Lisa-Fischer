Common weight name mapping
The numerical values 100 to 900 roughly correspond to the following common weight names (see the OpenType specification):

| Value Common | weight name               |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| 100          | Thin (Hairline)           |
| 200          | Extra Light (Ultra Light) |
| 300          | Light                     |
| 400          | Normal (Regular)          |
| 500          | Medium                    |
| 600          | Semi Bold (Demi Bold)     |
| 700          | Bold                      |
| 800          | Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)   |
| 900          | Black (Heavy)             |
